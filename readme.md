# 🚀 High-Scale Microservices Architecture Demo

> ⚠️ **Work In Progress**: This project is currently under active development. Features and documentation may be incomplete or subject to change.

A production-grade demonstration of cloud-native microservices architecture, implementing industry best practices for building highly scalable, maintainable, and resilient distributed systems.

## 💫 Why This Project?

This project showcases practical implementation of:
- **Scalability Patterns**: Demonstrates horizontal scaling capabilities with stateless services
- **System Design Principles**: SOLID, DRY, CQRS, and Clean Architecture patterns in action
- **Cloud-Native Development**: AWS-ready architecture with local development capabilities
- **Modern Dev Practices**: Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD ready, Containerization
- **Observability First**: Complete monitoring and logging infrastructure built-in

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Clear bounded contexts with Users and Orders domains
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through event-based communication
- **Defense in Depth**: Health checks, circuit breakers, and failover mechanisms
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Service isolation and independent scaling

### Backend Services 🔧
- **Users Service** (.NET 9.0)
  - Implements DDD tactical patterns
  - CQRS with clear separation of read/write concerns
  - Optimized query patterns with Entity Framework Core
  - RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation

- **Orders Service** (.NET 9.0)
  - Independent bounded context demonstration
  - Scalable order processing pipeline
  - Domain events for cross-service communication
  - Eventual consistency patterns

### Frontend 🎨
- Modern React application with TypeScript
- Material-UI components
- Real-time service health monitoring
- Clean and responsive UI
- Type-safe API integration

### Infrastructure 🌐
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store
- **LocalStack**: AWS service emulation for local development
  - Lambda functions for health checks
  - API Gateway integration
  - SSM Parameter Store for secure configuration
  
- **Observability Stack**:
  - Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
  - Loki for structured log aggregation
  - Promtail for automated log collection
  - Custom metrics and alerts
  - Performance monitoring
